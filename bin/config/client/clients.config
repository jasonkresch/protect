# This file contains a list of clients and their permissions for what operations they can perform on which secrets
#
# Each entry in this file is of the following form:
# [secret-name]
# username_1 = <generate,/store,/read,/info,/delete,/recover,/disable,/enable,/exponentiate,/sign>
# username_2 = <generate,/store,/read,/info,/delete,/recover,/disable,/enable,/exponentiate,/sign>

# Note that the [username] must match a public key stored in the client "keys" directory with the name "public-[username]"
#
# Permissions: A comma-separated list of permissions, supported permissions include:
#   - generate:     The ability to execute a DKG using this name to establish a secret (if one does not already exist with this name)
#   - store:        The ability for a client to directly store shares of a secret to this key name (if one does not already exist with this name)
#   - read:         The ability to recover a secret from its shares (should only be used for secrets that can be stored)
#   - info:         The ability to request information about this key, including the name, creation time, epoch, last-refresh time, prime field and group information (RSA/DH/EC)
#   - delete:       The ability to destroy the shares associated with this key, resetting its state and allowing a new key of this name to be created or stored.
#   - recover       The ability to initiate a share recovery for shares of this key after one the shares becomes lost or deleted.
#   - disable:      The ability to temporarily disable client actions from being performed against the shares of this key (note: does not prevent delete/enable/info)
#   - enable:       The ability to re-enable client actions from being performed against shares of this key
#   - exponentiate: The ability to compute an exponentiation (scalar multiply for EC curves) on a client-supplied base point: base^secret
#   - sign:         The ability to perform an signature operation on a client-supplied message: message^(secret=d) mod N.  Secrets of this form must be stored and be under RSA or BLS groups.
